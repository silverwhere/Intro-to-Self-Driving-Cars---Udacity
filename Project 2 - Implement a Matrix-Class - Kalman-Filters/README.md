# Matricies
Python Code for Matrices - Common Matrix Search and Multiplication Code

- matrix.py - This contains the beginnings of a Matrix class as well as some helper functions zeroes and identity. 

- matrix_playground.ipynb - A notebook that imports your Matrix class and calls the test code.
.
- matrix_cheat_sheet.ipynb - A Jupyter notebook with a glossary, explanation of matrix notation and list of matrix equations. 
                             Use this as a reference for the Matrix class!

- kalman_filter_demo.ipynb - Utilize matrix class to run a demo of a vehicle kalman filter demo

The following files can be ignored, but were used to demonstrate and help with demo code.

- test.py - Contains test code which demonstrates the expected functionality of your code.

- datagenerator.py - this just contains some helper code which is used by the Kalman Filter.
