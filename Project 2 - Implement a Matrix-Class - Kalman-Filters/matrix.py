        __init__ initializes the attributes of the class
        The __init__ method is similar to constructors in C++ and Java. Constructors are used to initialize the           
        objectâ€™s state. The task of         constructors is to initialize(assign values) to the data members of           
        the class when an object of class is created. Like methods, a constructor also contains                           
        collection of statements(i.e. instructions) that are executed at time of Object creation. It is run as           
        soon as an object of a class is instantiated. The method is useful to do any initialization you want to           
        do with your object.You can think of 'self' as a reference to the object that is running this method.  In         
        other words, when the initializer begins running the value of 'self' is set to refer to the                       
        instance that is being created. So, the assignment statement takes the value of 'grid' and                       
        assigns it to an attribute called 'g', which is added to the instance.
